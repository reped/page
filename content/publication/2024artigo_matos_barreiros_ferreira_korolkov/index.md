abstract: 'This study attempts to identify the geohistorical changes resulting from the establishment of space launch sites based on the experience of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The concept of geohistory proposed by Braudel (2015, p.630), bibliographic information, memoirs of Soviet scientists and military officers, and official documents were used for the analysis.First,geo-graphical and socio-political aspects related to the  establishment  of  space  launch  centers were studied, such as proximity to the equator, low population density, and others. It turns out that the Baikonur region suited the interests of the Soviet government at the time, which led to the transformation of a desert region into a dynamic center of interstate disputes during the Cold War. After the end of the Soviet Un-ion, changes in the socioeconomic conditions of the city and the cosmodrome led to a loss of dynamism  in  the  region.  Currently,  environmental issues and the new techno-economic paradigms of the space sector pose challenges to the continued importance of the Baikonur space center'
