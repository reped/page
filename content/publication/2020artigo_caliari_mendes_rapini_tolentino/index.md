abstract: 'The present article analyzes the role of cumulativeness in the definition of the technological innovative strategies of Brazilian industrial firms. The bibliographic references rely upon technological cumulativeness and technological capabilities, and the empirical analysis follows a classification based on Xiao et al. (Research Policy, 42(3), 749–764, 2013) and Viotti (Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 69(7), 653–680, 2002). Microdata from the Brazilian Innovation Survey (PINTEC) is analyzed for the years of 2008, 2011, and 2014. Econometric models (logit and panel data) are used to evaluate cumulativeness in the innovative process by analyzing time-lagged variables of innovative efforts (expenditures) and cooperative arrangements. Results suggest low cumulativeness in innovative efforts for both product and process innovations. The knowledge that comes from suppliers (product innovation) and competitors (process innovation) is found to be of greater importance, indicating passive-dependent strategies in process innovation and active-imitative in product innovation. In a nutshell, one can conclude that national technological backwardness is due to an absence of continuity and cumulativity in the innovative efforts of Brazilian firms.'
