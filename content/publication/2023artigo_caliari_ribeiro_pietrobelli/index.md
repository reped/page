abstract: 'This paper explores the link between a country´s position in the aerospace global value chain (GVC) and the strength of its innovation system. Countries` participation to different stages of the GVC is proxied using export data at a narrow product level, while innovation system indicators are built from US patents. The analysis covers the 2007–2018 period for 38 countries. Our results highlight a relationship between the strength of the innovation system and a country´s participation and specialization in different stages of the aerospace GVC - varied and pervasive (quality) rather than more intensive (quantity) innovation systems are associated with a stronger presence in higher value-added stages of the value chain. These results highlight the importance of improving an innovation system targeting the development of a differentiated knowledge base and fostering the integration of different actors to sustain the aerospace industry and facilitate upgrading within the value chain.'
