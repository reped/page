abstract: 'This  paper  aims  to  analyze  the  Public  Procurement  of  Innovation  (PPI)  model  applied  to  complex  defense  systems  acquisition  processes,  the  opportunities  generated  by  this  type  of  contracting  as  well  as  its  legal  security.  The  research  included  literature  and  document  review,  considering  the  literature  that  addresses  the  process  of  obtaining  defense  products  in  Brazil,  since PPI could benefit the national defense industrial base in the  development  of  technological  solutions  capable  of  replacing  options  provided  by  the  international  market,  which  historically  have been subject to restrictions and embargoes by countries that have control over sensitive technologies. The study demonstrated that   despite   the   possibility   provided   by   the   legislation,   few   processes  for  defense  systems  acquisition  have  relied  on  PPI,  until  now.  The  research  allowed  us  to  conclude  that  due  to  the  complexity  of  a  process  of  complex  defense  systems  acquisitions,  the  full  use  of  PPI  will  only  be  possible  through  the  elaboration  of an internal regulation by the Ministry of Defense detailing the process to be followed when contracting a product through a PPI approved by the Audit Institutions.'
