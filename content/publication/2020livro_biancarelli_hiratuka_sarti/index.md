abstract: 'The chapter by Biancarelli reinforces the idea that all dimensions involved in processes of regional physical investment need to flow together; basic political understandings, intra-regional trade and a favourable climate for cross border investments, institutional rules that provide clear signals, and clear cut decisions that help ensure investments and projects support the overarching goal (which in this case was regional connectivity.) Biancarelli’s conclusion is that bolstering South America’s efforts towards development, and productive and financial integration requires more than finance and even more than overarching supporting institutions, there is also a need for the design and implementation of appropriate policies, intervention measures and coordinated strategies (among countries and public/private agents) to achieve these goals.'
